# DeepLearning-shugyou

My personal training to understand Deep Learning deeply...

## Setup

1. Install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), a comfy Python environment for data processing.
   You can find an installer on the above site.
2. Install [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/), a Neural Network library.

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git    
    ```
    
    Note: I encountered errors when using pybrain package in PyPI.
    I recommend to install package in GitHub.
